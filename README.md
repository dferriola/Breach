Data Collection and Cleaning

I acquired data from the two websites below:

    data source 1 : brief description about the data source
    data source 2 : brief description about the data source

Describe your data, data collection methods and tools if any Describe data cleaning procedure if any.
Describe your exploratory data analysis methods and results.

Below are some made-up examples
Ex1: The data has 42,000 samples and 12 features including ...(list a few that you think important), and is all numeric values and has no null values. The label is the transaction amount in dollar which values between 10 and 499.

Ex2: The data was acquired from 2 sources and they consist of 3 tables. Table 1 contains school information and their internal evaluation data. Table 2 contains demographic and socioeconomic data by zip code. I joined them using SQL (or Pandas), then cleaned data by (your data cleaning methods).

Ex3: The train dataset has 12000 images in jpeg format. The image sizes are all different, so I rescaled to 100x100 pixels. All pixel values are standardized such that it has zero mean and pixel values are between -0.5 to 0.5.

Include figures or tables if needed. When you post an image put correct path (directory, filename) for your git (or local directory your md file is in). The example below works when there is a folder "images" which has "example.png" in the directory where this md file is in. The github should also include those correctly to render correctly on the web.

Analysis methods

Describe your analysis methods and brief explanations on your assumption. Include figures or tables as needed.
When writing analysis method, also explicitly mention which tools and libraries you used (imagine this is your portfolio to your future employer- you want to be as impressive as possible) Results from your analysis.
Analysis 2 (optional)

Describe your analysis methods. Include figures or tables as needed.
Analysis results
Results

You can make model(s) comparison if you have multiple approaches. You may include any tables or graphs that summarizes your result(s). Your conclusion, any discussions on difficulties (why some approach didn't work), and any ideas how you may overcome those. If you have external demo website, you can include a link your webapp.
Summary (optional)

Summarize your work and highlight your takeaways. You may include ideas on how you may improve the analysis, or future steps.
